# Problem statement
## Task
Read in two integers,  and , and print three lines.
The first line is the integer division  (While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__).
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: .
The third line prints the divmod of  and .
## Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, , and the second line contains the second integer, .
## Output Format
Print the result as described above.
## Sample Input
`177`  
`10`  
## Sample Output
`17`  
`7`

# My approach
Very simple take two numbers input as integer.

print integer division.  
print modulor.  
print divmod.

And all done üëç.
