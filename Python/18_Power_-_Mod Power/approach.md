# Problem statement
## Task
You are given three integers: a, b, and m. Print two lines.
On the first line, print the result of pow(a,b). On the second line, print the result of pow(a.b.m).
## Input Format
The first line contains a, the second line contains b, and the third line contains m.
## Constraints
1 <= a <= 10
1 <= b <= 10
2 <= m <= 1000
## Sample Input
`3`  
`4`  
`5`  
## Sample Output
`81`  
`1`

# My approach
Take input in 3 lines a, b, and m. Just print the `pow(a,b)` / `a**b` in first line and in second line `pow(a,b,m)`.

And all done 👍.
