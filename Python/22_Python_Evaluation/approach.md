# Problem statement
## Task
You are given an expression in a line. Read that line as a string variable, such as var, and print the result using eval(var).
NOTE: Python2 users, please import from_future_ import print_function.
## Constraint
Input string is less than 100 characters.
## Sample Input
`print (2 + 3)`  
## Sample Output
`5`

# My approach
Just a simple 2 line code. Take input from user which is a statement. Store the statement or for one line code just pass `input()` function as argument in `eval()` function like this `eval(input())`.
The `eval()` function do the rest work.

And all done 👍.
