# Problem statement
## Task
Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of ab + cd.
$$ Input Format
Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.
## Constraints
1 <= a <= 1000
1 <= b <= 1000
1 <= c <= 1000
1 <= d <= 1000
## Output Format
Print the result of a^b + c^d on one line.
## Sample Input
`9`  
`29`  
`7`  
`27`  
## Sample Output
`4710194409608608369201743232`

# My approach
Just 2 line code, take 4 integer number a, b, c, d input in one line or can go with four separate lines. Then just print the addition of a to the power b and c to the power d.  

And all done 👍.
